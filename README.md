# AMP Blogger templates

This repository contains an AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) based responsive theme that can be used with Blogger. The blog is resposive & a live demo can be seen at [amp-blog.kolappan.dev](https://amp-blog.kolappan.dev). You can find see the list of blogger feature that works and doesn't works in [here](https://amp-blog.kolappan.dev/2020/10/what-works-and-what-does-not.html).

**Notice:** Before you proceed note that this template does not pass the AMP Validation, Yet. There are some limitations in Blogger that I find it impossible to workaround at the moment. Some of them are
 - The style tags in the error are inserted automatically by Blogger. Some of them such as b:skin cannot be removed.
 - The quickedit icon which causes 3 errors is part of footer and I don't know how to remove it. I have removed all other quick edit icons.
 - ATOM/XML is a valid MIME type. Ref: [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/atom+xml). But the AMP validator doesn't recognize it.
